<!-- Software and Data Carpentry are both communities of volunteer researchers, educators, and more who develop lessons and teach two day workshops on basic computing and data skills for researchers. Software Carpentry focuses on helping researchers develop foundational computational skills; Data Carpentry focuses on helping researchers work effectively with their data through its lifecycle. -->

<!-- The main goal of these organizations is not to teach specific skills, per se - although those are covered - but rather, to convey best practices that will enable researchers to be more productive and do better research. -->

<!-- Just like learning a new language, a musical instrument, or a sport, teaching is a skill that requires practice and feedback. -->

<!-- The key tool for R is knitr, which allows you to create a document that is a mixture of text and some chunks of code. When the document is processed by knitr, chunks of R code will be executed, and graphs or other results inserted. -->

<!-- This sort of idea has been called “literate programming”. -->

# Reproducible Research

Reproducible research is one possible product of dynamic documents, however, it is not guaranteed! Good practices for reproducible research include:

* Encapsulate the full project into one directory that is supported with version control.
* Release your code and data.
* Document everything and use code as documentation!
* Make figures, tables, and statistics the results of scripts and inline code.
* Write code that uses relative paths.
* Always Set your seed.
* Always include session information in the code file. For example, you can use devtools::session_info().
* To read more about reproducibility and data management check out Vince Buffalo’s Book(Buffalo, 2015).
* `ggplot2`
* [``](https://github.com/hadley/healthyr_preamble)

How things get compiled? When you press the “Knit HTML” button, the R Markdown document is processed by knitr and a plain Markdown document is produced (as well as, potentially, a set of figure files): the R code is executed and replaced by both the input and the output; if figures are produced, links to those figures are included.

The Markdown and figure documents are then processed by the tool pandoc, which converts the Markdown file into an html file, with the figures embedded.

# (R)Markdown {#rmarkdown}

Philosophy ...

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. – John Gruber.

To fully understand R Markdown, we first need to cover Markdown, which is a system for writing simple, readable text that is easily converted to HTML. Markdown essentially is two things:

A plain text formatting syntax
A software tool written in Perl.
Converts the plain text formatting into HTML.

> Main goal of Markdown: Make the syntax of the raw (pre-HTML) document as readable possible.

## YAML

Der YAML header bestimmt wie das Dokument kompeliert wird. YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” and is basically a nested list structure that includes the metadata of the document. It is enclosed between two lines of three dashes --- and as we saw above is automatically written by RStudio. A simple example:

    ---
    title: "HTML example"
    output: html_document
    ---

* [Overview of Output Formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html)

![](src/images/rmd_outputs.png)


Zur Auswahl stehen verschiedene Standardformate. Neben diesen drei Typischen Formaten stehen Erweiterungen für HTML bereit.


```{r, echo = F}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
dat <- rbind(
  c("html_document", "HTML"),
  c("pdf_document", "PDF"),
  c("word_document", "Microsoft Word (.docx)"),
  c("odt_document", "Open Document Text"),
  c("rtf_document", "Rich Text Format"),
  c("md_document", "Markdown (converts R to md)"),
  c("github_document", "Markdown (github special)"),
  c("ioslides_presentation", "ioslides (HTML 5 slideshow)"),
  c("slidy_presentation", "slidy (HTML 5 slideshow)"),
  c("beamer_presentation", "beamer (pdf slideshow)")
) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rename(Code = V1, Output = V2)

dat %>%
  formattable::format_table(caption = "Standard Outputs delivered by Rmarkdown")
```



## Headers 

**Setext-style**: A setext-style header is a line of text underlined with a row of = signs (level 1) or - signs (for level 2). This often used in Dashboard applications. 

    A level-one header
    ==================
    
    A level-two header
    ------------------

**ATX-style**: extend up to six `#` signs at the beginning of the line is the header level. ATX can include text formatting. 

    ## A level-one header
    
    ### A level-two header *emphasis*


A ATX Header allows header_attributes
which can be assigned using the following syntax at the end of the header line:

    # Section {#identifier .class .class key=value key=value}    

If you specified the YAML option `number_sections: true` you can disable the numbering for a specific header:

    # My header {-}

is just the same as
    
    # My header {.unnumbered}


## Tabbed Sections {#tabbed .tabset}

### Content

    ~~durchgestrichener Text~~


* *kurisver Text*
* **fetter Text**
* ~~durchgestrichener Text~~

If you work in a HTML document, you can use raw HTML in your Markdown File. A brief introduction can be found [here](* [HTML Text Formatting **w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp).


## Formula

In Markdown you can do easy Subscript~2~ and Superscript^2^ with any additional concepts. If you want to write full mathematical equations MathJax is waiting for you.

Any Rmd format is able to incorporate $\LaTeX$ formula in the document. You can do inline code like *the average income in this region is* $\bar x = 1.32$. This is done by 

    *the average income in this region is* $\bar x = 1.32$.

You can also create standalone formula

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \varepsilon_i $$

This is easily done ... 

    $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \varepsilon_i $$

| Binary operators   | `$\times$ $\otimes$$\oplus$ $\cup$ $\cap$`                         | $\times$ $\otimes$$\oplus$ $\cup$ $\cap$                         |
| Relation operators | `$\subset$ $\supset$ $\subseteq$ $\supseteq$`      | $\subset$ $\supset$ $\subseteq$ $\supseteq$      |
| Others             | `$\prod$ $\sum$ $\int$ $\oint$ $\sum$ $\prod$`                                     | $\prod$ $\sum$ $\int$ $\oint$ $\sum$ $\prod$                                     |


## Images

You can source external images also for all RMD output formats via (weblink)

    ![](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03519/potd-squirrel_3519920k.jpg)

![](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03519/potd-squirrel_3519920k.jpg)

or from your local image folder:

    ![](src/images/squirrel.jpg)

<img src = "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03519/potd-squirrel_3519920k.jpg", width = "70%">

Of course you can use raw HTML in `html_document`

<img src = "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archi
ve/03519/potd-squirrel_3519920k.jpg", width = "50%">
    
    <img src = "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03519/potd-squirrel_3519920k.jpg", width = "50%">


For the **PDF** version only `knitr` offers a function which mimics the $\LaTeX$ include graphic command. This image can be reformatted easily. 

    ```
    knitr::include_graphics("src/images/squirrel.jpg")
    ```

## Citations

It’s also possible to include a bibliography file in the YAML header. Bibliography formats that are readable by Pandoc include the following:

* MODS (.mods)
* BibLaTeX	(.bib)
* BibTeX	(.bibtex)
* RIS	(.ris)
* EndNote	(.enl)
* EndNote XML	(.xml)
* ISI	(.wos)
* MEDLINE	(.medline)
* Copac	(.copac)
* JSON citeproc	(.json) 

To create a bibliography in RMarkdown, two files are needed:

1. A bibliography file with the information about each reference. A citation style language (CSL) to describe how to format the reference. 
2. An example YAML header with a bibliography and a citation style language (CSL) file:

    ```
    output: html_document
    bibliography: bibliography.bib
    csl: nature.csl
    ```

If you would like to cite R packages, knitr even includes a function called write_bib() that creates a .bib entries for R packages. It will even write it to a file!


```{r, eval = F}
#knitr::write_bib(file = "r-packages.bib") 
knitr::write_bib(c("knitr", "ggplot2"), file = "r-packages2.bib")
```

# R Code

## Embed Code {#embed}

There are 2 ways to embed code within an RMarkdown document.

Inline Code: Brief code that takes place during the written part of the document.

Code Chunks: Parts of the document that includes several lines of program or analysis code. It may render a plot or table, calculate summary statistics, load packages, etc.

    ```{r chunkname, echo=T}`r ''`
    1 + 1
    ```
   
While knitr must be run within the R environment, it also supports many other programming languages including:

* Python
* Ruby
* Haskell
* shell scripts
* Perl
* SAS
* TikZ
* Graphviz
* C++
* ...

However, we have to install the corresponding software package in advance to use an engine.


### Chunk Options

| option     | default | effect                                                    |
|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| eval       | TRUE    | Whether to evaluate the code and include its results      |
| echo       | TRUE    | Whether to display code along with its results            |
| warning    | TRUE    | Whether to display warnings                               |
| error      | FALSE   |  Whether to display errors                                |
| message    | TRUE    | Whether to display messages                               |
| tidy       | FALSE   | Whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it |
| results    | markup  | "markup", "asis", "hold", or "hide"                       |
| cache      | FALSE   | Whether to cache results for future renders               |
| comment    | ##      | Comment character to preface results with                 |
| fig.width  | 7       | Width in inches for plots created in chunk                |
| fig.height | 7       | Height in inches for plots created in chunk               |

### Global Options

You may wish to have the same chunk settings throughout your document and so it might be nice to type options once instead of always re-typing it for each chunk. To do so, you can set global chunk options at the top of the document.

    ```
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(
      echo = F, 
      eval = T, 
      message = F,
      warning = F, 
      fig.path = "images/",
      fig.width = 12, 
      fig.height = 8
    )
    ```


## Emo[ji] {#emo}

* [Wickham github](https://github.com/hadley/emo)
* [Emoji List](http://emoji.muan.co/)
* `r emo::ji("smile")` `r emo::ji("eu")` `r emo::ji("dancing")`

    ```
    emo::ji("smile")
    ```

## Tables

Markdown has a nativ pandoc table format. This can be nonetheless sometimes inconvient to write manually tables. [Tablesgenerator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) is website that supports you writing all sorts of table formats. Here is a Markdown table:

    | x      | y      |
    |--------|--------|
    | Hello  | World! |

The result looks like:

| x      | y      |
|--------|--------|
| Hello  | World! |

Depending on your desired output AND data format different packages for beautiful tables are at disposal.
